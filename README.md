# Cell Domination
This is a simple game where you play against computer and should take as many cells as you can by clicking on cell borders until they are filled. Whoever clicked on the last cell's border takes it. Whoever took most of the cells - wins.
If cell has only one open border, you can click on the cell itself to take it.

A demo can be found [here](https://iluzyanin.github.io/celldomination/).

Built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) template.
